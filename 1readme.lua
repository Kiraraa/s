--[[ SAFETY
I am not responsible if your account got banned.
I don't recommend using this on your main account.
And if you're banned, usually it's because someone reported you to their discord server.
]]

--[[ MAPS
If the map that you teleported to is locked, use the Map Lock Bypass in miscellaneous.
Drop Zone = an area where shards and diamonds drop.
More players in the server = higher drop rate.
At Minilovania, you can use "Sans Element" for free.
]]

--[[ FARM EXP
You need the element and the 2nd spell for the exp farm.
You can only use one at a time.
Fire element is recommended.
]]

--[[ FARM DROPS
I don't recommend enabling tp to shards & diamonds in standard map, the drop rate is so low. Even if the server is full.
